Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When you would like to collaborate with others, when you want edit source code from multiple systems, when you want to push changes to a remote server (Heroku?), to back up your repository

commands: git remote (see all git remotes)
git remote add NAME GITHUBURL (standard default name is origin)
git remove -v (verbose output shows feth and push urls) 

Push repository to remote: git push origin master
Pull repository from remote: git pull origin master

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because you could be be busy modifying your version of master that could have conflicts with whats on GitHub. If you have branched your changes it might not be an issue, but it is better to be in control to keep track of the log
