Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When you would like to collaborate with others, when you want edit source code from multiple systems, when you want to push changes to a remote server (Heroku?), to back up your repository

commands: git remote (see all git remotes)
git remote add NAME GITHUBURL (standard default name is origin)
git remove -v (verbose output shows feth and push urls) 

Push repository to remote: git push origin master
Pull repository from remote: git pull origin master
